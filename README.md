# Automatically Install Developer Tools

You can install all recommendations automatically using the provided script or individually install whatever you prefer.

The script will prompt you to enter your root password multiple times. Some users experience more than 20 password prompts every 5-10 seconds. This behavior is normal.

To get started, open your standard Terminal (Command + Space -> "Terminal"). Check the right path to the file.

```bash
bash mac_dev_setup.sh
```
